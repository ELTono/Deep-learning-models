# Deep-learning-models

This repository contains my coursework of the module "Advanced deep learning and reinforcement learning". The 4 assignments correspond to the deep learning section of the course. All of them were coding in tensorflow and python. I hope they are useful for anyone who want to practice coding some deep networks as LSTM and ConvNet. I personally enjoyed a lot this module, I recommend a lot to have a check on coursework 4. This coursework contains a really nice implementation of pixel RNN with some exercises that help a lot to understand the model.

## Coursework 1
This one is a basic exercise using simple full connected networks and convolutional neural network. It is a good exercise to start with tensorflow.

## Coursework 2
In this assigment we implemented from scratch the networks in coursework 1. This include the feed forward and the backpropagation to train the models.

## Coursework 3.
This one is about an implementation of an RNN to do pixel prediction.
